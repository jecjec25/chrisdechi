<h3>[Chorus: Adam Levine & (Theron Thomas)]</h3>
<p class="Chorus">If I got locked away<br>
And we lost it all today<br>
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?<br>
If I showed you my flaws<br>
If I couldn't be strong<br>
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?<br>
(Right about now)<br>
</p>

<h3>[Verse 1: Theron Thomas]</h3>
<p class="verse">
If a judge 'for life' me, would ya stay by my side?<br>
Or is you gonna say goodbye?<br>
Can you tell me right now?<br>
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life<br>
Shawty, would it be alright?<br>
Come on, show me that you are down<br>
</p>

<h3>[Pre-Chorus: Timothy Thomas, Theron Thomas]</h3>
<p class="prechorus">
Now tell me, would you really ride for me?<br>
(Would you really ride for me?)<br>
Baby, tell me, would you die for me?<br>
(Tell me, would you die for me?)<br>
Would you spend your whole life with me? (Wassup)<br>
Would you be there to always hold me down?<br>
Tell me, would you really cry for me?<br>
(Would you really cry for me?)<br>
Baby, don't lie to me (Baby, don't lie to me)<br>
If I didn't have anything (Wassup)<br>
I wanna know, would you stick around?<br>
</p>

<h3>[Chorus: Adam Levine]</h3>

If I got locked away<br>

If I couldn't be strong<br>
Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?<br>

<h3>[Verse 2: Timothy Thomas]</h3>
<p class="verse">
Skiddly dong, dong, dong, dang<br>
All I want is somebody real, who don't need much<br>
A gyal I know that I can trust<br>
To be here when money low<br>
If I did not have nothing else to give but love<br>
Would that even be enough? (Tell me, tell me, tell me)<br>
Gyal me need fi know, aha<br>
